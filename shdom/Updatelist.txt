 7MAR14   Major upgrade release: beta distribution of polarized SHDOM.
          Parallelized (with MPI) visualization output option.
          Fortran 90 compiler is now required (main program is shdom.f90).
          Fixed bugs in visualization output (camera images flipped in
          sample direction, cross-track images flipped in line).
          Fixed bug in Flux output format 2 that made garbage output.
          Dropped make_ice_table.f90, cloudprp.f, ckdfu.f, ckdswrrtm.f,
          ckdlwrrtm.f, and several old scripts from distribution.

             output formats to netcdf files (thanks to Robert Pincus).

 3MAR08   Fixed open boundary condition bug in DIRECT_BEAM_PROP.
            (Thanks to Richard Siddans)

 6JUNE05  Limited SHDOM acceleration parameter to be less than 10; having
             no limit might have caused divergence for optically thick IPA.
           Fixed make_ice_table.f90 database reading allocation bug.
           Fixed lowest level indexing error in ckdlwrrtm.f (27-JAN-2004).

10JULY03  Corrected problem with ice scattering database (sw_ice_scatter.db)
             by rescaling extinction efficiency, single scattering albedo, 
             and asymmetry parameter for "delta transmission" of rays
             through parallel ice crystal faces.

20JUNE03  Major upgrade release.
           Added new optical property file generation system consisting
             of make_mie_table.f90 and make_ice_table.f90 for creating
             single scattering table files for spherical particles
             and 8 shapes of ice crystals (shortwave only), and 
             propgen.f90 for producing property files with arbitrary
             mixtures of particles at each grid point.
           Added modified version of 6S ocean surface reflectance BRDF 
             model to SHDOM (wavelength is now a required input parameter).
           Modified RPV BRDF surface reflection function according to
             Alexei Lyapustin for added robustness.
           Added camera and cross-track scanning image "visualization"
             output to SHDOM and example scripts and IDL programs.
           Added longwave and shortwave RRTM based k-distribution programs.

27JULY99  Modified cloudprp to change aerosol input file format (added 
           distribution width and index of refraction dependence on wavelength)

 1JUNE99  Major upgrade release.

           Included documentation file for cloudprp and ckdfu.
           Included more example scripts in distribution.
           Included IDL SHDOM file input and visualization procedures.

           Fixed horizontal range of radiance output in open boundary conditions
             Note: this changed the input parameters for radiance output.
           Added input parameter checking subroutine.
           Fixed bugs for large optical depth per grid cell in    (5/98)
             k-distributions by initializing for each k (INRADFLAG=.FALSE.).
           Fixed bug for isotropic source function with NPHI>32.  (1/99)

             negative phase function from severe Legendre truncation.


20JUN97   Added general surface bidirectional reflectance functions.
           Added open horizontal boundary conditions (new input - BCFLAG).

11JUL96   Put in reading Z base grid from zgrid.inp file (GRIDTYPE='F').
           Allowed delta-M mode for thermal source.
           Referred to online journal article in documentation.
