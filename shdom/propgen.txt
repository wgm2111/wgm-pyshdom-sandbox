            SHDOM Property File Generation System


The optical property file generation system for SHDOM converts physical
properties of particle distributions into optical property files input
to SHDOM.  The polarized SHDOM distribution has three Fortran 90
programs: make_mie_table.f90 and make_tmatrix_table.f90 for making
scattering tables and propgen.f90 for generating the property file from
a particle properties file.  The particle properties file specifies the
mass content (g/m^3) and effective radius (microns) of each particle
component at each grid point.  The make_mie_table program generates
scattering tables for gamma or lognormal size distributions of spherical
particles, while make_tmatrix_table generates scattering tables for
gamma or lognormal size distributions of spheroidal or cylindrical
particles.  The program plotscattab.f90 makes a plotting file of phase
matrix elements versus angle from the Wigner d-function series in a
scattering table file.  The propgen program allows an arbitrary mixture
of any number of pure components at each grid point.  The extinction and
single scattering albedo from all the components are combined exactly,
while phase functions existing in the scattering tables and newly
created phase functions are chosen so that the phase function error is
smaller than user specified tolerances. The result is a tabulated phase
function format property file for SHDOM with a small as possible memory
requirement that closely approximates the desired optical property
distribution.

The example Unix script "run_polarized_example" shows how to make
scattering tables and run propgen to generate a property file for SHDOM.
Scattering tables are made for lognormal distributions of spheroidal
dust aerosols and gamma distributions of cloud water droplets,  The
example particle file "les_cumulus_dust.part" specifies the mass content
and effective radius distributions for a horizontally uniform aerosol
layer (particle type 1) from the surface to 5 km, and a cumulus water
cloud layer (type 2) from 0 to 2.7 km.
   The distribution includes an IDL program "plot_polarized_example.pro"
which plots the components of the particle file, the resulting
extinction and single scattering albedo fields, and I, Q, U radiance
output from SHDOM (requires other IDL files in the SHDOM distribution).



                       MAKE_MIE_TABLE

Make_mie_table calculates the single scattering properties of gamma,
modified gamma, or lognormal distributions of spherical particles and
outputs the results in a scattering table.  If the particle type is
water or ice then an integration across the specified wavelength band
may be performed.  If an aerosol particle type is chosen then the index
of refraction of the aerosol is specified.

For water or ice particles an integration across the wavelength range
may be done.  In this case a series of Mie calculations are performed at
a specified wavelength spacing using the correct index of refraction for
each wavelength.  The alternative is to use the Planck function averaged
index of refraction and central wavelength, which takes less computation
but may be less accurate (depending on the spectral band width).  For
solar wavelengths (< 3 um) the Planck function is for a solar
temperature (5800 K), for longwave wavelengths (> 5 um) the Planck
function is for an atmospheric temperature (270 K), while between 3 and
5 um a straight average is used.

If an aerosol particle type is chosen then the particle bulk density of
the aerosol is specified.  The density is needed because the output
scattering table extinction is normalized for a mass content of 1 g/m^3.

The gamma distribution of particle droplet sizes is
     n(r) = a r^alpha exp(-b*r)
 where r is the particle radius, and a, b, alpha specify the gamma
distribution.  The number concentration of droplets is 
  N = a Gamma(alpha+1)/ b^(alpha+1), where Gamma is the gamma function.
The effective radius of the distribution is r_eff = (alpha+3)/b, while
the effective variance is v_eff = 1/(alpha+3).  A typical value for 
water clouds is v_eff=0.1 or alpha=7.  For ice clouds a typical value is
alpha=1 or 2.  An exponential distribution is obtained with alpha=0.  A
large value of alpha gives close to a monodisperse distribution.

The modified gamma distribution of particle sizes is
     n(r) = a r^alpha exp(-b*r^gamma)
 where r is the particle radius, and a, b, alpha, gamma specify the
modified gamma distribution.  

The lognormal distribution of particle sizes is
     n(r) = a/r exp( -[ln(r/r0)]^2 / (2*sigma^2) )
 where r0 is the logarithmic mode of the distribution and sigma is the
standard deviation of the log.  The number concentration of droplets is
N = sqrt(2*pi)*sigma*a.  The effective radius of the distribution is
r_eff = r0*exp(2.5*sigma^2) and the effective variance of the
distribution is v_eff = exp(sigma^2)-1.  A common value for water clouds
is sigma=.35, or v_eff=0.130, and a common value for aerosol distributions
is sigma=0.7.

The maximum radius of the distribution is specified by the user because
it is the critical determinant of the Mie calculation computer time.
There are often microphysical reasons for truncating the theoretical
size distribution; for example, one might say that the cloud droplet
mode ends at a radius of 50 microns.  For a narrow gamma distribution
(alpha=7) of cloud droplets, a maximum radius of only twice the largest
effective radius gives virtually the same optical properties as the 
untruncated gamma distribution.  For a wide lognormal distribution, as
might be used for an aerosol distribution, a much larger maximum radius
relative to the largest effective radius would be required if no
truncation was desired.  If there is truncation make_mie_table uses an
iterative procedure to adjust the size distribution modal radius to
achieve the desired effective radius.  Thus one can be assured that the
size distributions have the effective radii reported in the output
scattering table even if there is truncation of the theoretical
distribution.  The number and spacing of the integration steps over the
size distribution is controlled by the GET_NSIZE and GET_SIZES
subroutines.  The default formula is DELX = max(0.01,0.03*X**0.5),
where X is the size parameter (2*pi*r/lambda, lambda=wavelength)
and DELX is the integration step.  This integration spacing is
adequate for most purposes, but can be easily changed if higher
accuracy is sought.

                       MAKE_TMATRIX_TABLE

Make_tmatrix_table calculates the single scattering properties of gamma,
modified gamma, or lognormal distributions of spheroidal or cylindrical
particles of a specified aspect ratio and outputs the results in a
scattering table.  A slightly modified version of the T-matrix code of
Mishchenko is used.  This is the double precision version of the
Mishchenko T-matrix code, which will not converge for as large size
parameters or extreme axis ratios as the quad-precision version.  For
more information on this T-matrix implementation see the comments at the
beginning of tmatrixwig.f and the journal article:
  M. I. Mishchenko and L. D. Travis, Capabilities and limitations of a 
current FORTRAN implementation of the T-matrix method for randomly
oriented, rotationally    symmetric scatterers, J. Quant. Spectrosc.
Radiat. Transfer, vol. 60, 309-324 (1998).

If the particle type is water or ice then the index of refraction is
determined from the wavelength.  If an "aerosol" particle type is chosen
then the index of refraction of the particles and the bulk density of
the aerosol are specified.  The density is needed because the output
scattering table extinction is normalized for a mass content of 1 g/m^3.
A single wavelength is specified, and there is no integration across a
wavelength range.

The size distributions are specified in the equivalent spherical volume
radius of the spheroidal or cylindrical particles.
  The gamma distribution of particle sizes is
     n(r) = a r^alpha exp(-b*r)
 where r is the equivalent volume radius, and a, b, alpha specify the
gamma distribution.  
  The modified gamma distribution of particle sizes is
     n(r) = a r^alpha exp(-b*r^gamma)
 where r is the equivalent volume radius, and a, b, alpha, gamma specify
the modified gamma distribution.  
  The lognormal distribution of particle sizes is
     n(r) = a/r exp( -[ln(r/r0)]^2 / (2*sigma^2) )
 where r0 is the logarithmic mode of the distribution and sigma is the
standard deviation of the log.  

The maximum radius of the distribution is specified by the user because
it is the critical determinant of the calculation computer time.  If
there is truncation make_tmatrix_table uses an iterative procedure to
adjust the size distribution modal radius to achieve the desired
effective radius.  Thus one can be assured that the size distributions
have the effective radii reported in the output scattering table even if
there is truncation of the theoretical distribution.  The number and
spacing of the integration steps over the size distribution is
controlled by the GET_NSIZE and GET_SIZES subroutines.  The default
formula is DELX = max(0.01,0.03*X**0.5), where X is the size parameter
(2*pi*r/lambda, lambda=wavelength) and DELX is the integration step. 
This integration spacing is adequate for most purposes, but can be
easily changed if higher accuracy is sought.

                        PROPGEN

Propgen generates an optical property file for SHDOM from a particle
property file specifying the 3D distribution of mass content and
effective radius for several types of particles.  The optical properties
for these particle types are specified in scattering table files.  The
optical properties are interpolated in effective radius within the
scattering tables (logarithmically for extinction and linearly for
single scattering albedo and phase function).  The extinction and
single scattering albedo for the mixture specified at each grid point
are calculated exactly.  The phase functions for the mixtures are
approximate, however, because there is not enough memory to store a
phase function for each grid point.  Instead, the closest phase function
to the correct one is used.  If none of the phase functions in the
scattering tables are within the user specified tolerances then the new
mixture phase function is added to the list.  Tolerances are specified
for the asymmetry parameter and the maximum fractional error in phase
function values.

There are three parameters that control the creation of new phase
functions.  The first is the maximum number of phase functions that may
be created, which is designed to limit the memory use by SHDOM.  The
second and third parameters are the tolerance in asymmetry parameter
error and the tolerance in maximum fractional error in phase function
values.  The maximum fractional phase function error is calculated at 90
angles from 2 to 180 degrees, but this can be changed by changing the
 "INTEGER, PARAMETER :: NANGLES=90" statement in propgen.f90.  Smaller
values of the two tolerances will produce a more accurate property file,
but at the expense of a larger number of phase functions.  If the
property file is to be used only for flux computations then the
asymmetry parameter tolerance is most important and the fractional phase
function tolerance can be set large.  If the property file is to be used
for radiance calculations then the fractional error in phase function
tolerance is more important.  If you are outputting a one-dimensional
property file, then you can set the tolerances to zero to get one phase
function for each output level (actually the program has minimum values
of 0.002 for the asymmetry parameter tolerance and 0.01 for the
fractional phase function tolerance).  Propgen only outputs the phase
functions actually used in the property file, not all the ones in the
scattering tables.  If 1000 or more phase functions are going to be
output then the Fortran format statement in subroutine OUTPUT_PROPERTIES
will need to be changed.

In addition to the scattering properties from the input particles,
propgen also calculates and includes molecular Rayleigh scattering.  The
user specifies a wavelength and surface pressure for Rayleigh
scattering, and the Rayleigh extinction coefficient (in terms of air
pressure and temperature) is obtained from equation 30 in
  Bodhaine, B. A., N. B. Wood, E. G. Dutton, and J. R. Slusser (1999),
On Rayleigh optical depth calculations, J. Atmos. Oceanic. Technol., 16,
1854-1861.
  Propgen uses the hypsometric relation to calculate the pressure
profile from the input temperature profile.  The input surface pressure
for Rayleigh scattering corresponds to the zero height level in the 
propgen input.  If no Rayleigh scattering is desired, the RAYSFCPRES
input may be set to zero.
  The Rayleigh scattering phase function (and phase matrix for
polarization) now includes the wavelength dependent depolarization
factor.

Typically a cloud field occupies only small portion of the atmospheric
profile and the other height levels are used to fill in the rest of the
atmosphere.  The other height levels should be chosen according to the
needs of SHDOM and the molecular absorption and scattering profile. 
SHDOM needs some vertical resolution to resolve the radiance field.  If
molecular Rayleigh scattering is significant, then the other levels must
exist in clear sky to put that scattering in the property file. 
Similarly, if a k-distribution file is giving the molecular absorption,
then other levels must cover the range where the absorption is
significant.  For example, stratospheric levels need to be included for
ozone absorption in the ultraviolet.  If the particle file name is
specified as "NONE" then only molecular Rayleigh scattering is  included
and there must be other height levels.


                     Particle Properties File

The particle file specifies the three-dimensional distribution of mass
content (g/m^3) and effective radius (microns) for each component type
of particle.  Only the the particle types with nonzero mass content need
to be specified at each grid point.  The particle file is an ascii text
file with the following format:
   3            [format type]
   Nx Ny Nz     [number of X, Y, Z grid points]
   delX delY    [X and Y grid spacing in km]   
   Z1 ... Zn    [heights of particle levels in km]
   T1 ... Tn    [temperatures in Kelvin at these levels]
   IX IY IZ  Numcomp  Type1 Mass1 Reff1 ... TypeN MassN ReffN
    . . .
 Numcomp is the number of particle components, Type? are the type
numbers of the components, Mass? are the mass contents [g/m^3] of the
components, and Reff? are the effective radii [microns] of the
components.  See file "les_cumulus_dust.part" made by the
run_polarized_example script in the distribution for an example particle
file.  There may be missing grid points, in which case the empty grid
has no particles.  In addition to this new particle file format, propgen
can read the old 2 parameter LWC files that cloudprp used, which has
the format:
   2            [format type]
   Nx Ny Nz     [number of X, Y, Z grid points]
   delX delY    [X and Y grid spacing in km]   
   Z1 ... Zn    [heights of cloud levels in km]
   T1 ... Tn    [temperatures in Kelvin]
   IX IY IZ LWC Reff
 The LWC is the liquid water content [g/m^3], and Reff is the effective
radius [micron] at each cloudy grid point.  See file
"aero0822nh15c_t13_iy249.lwc" in the distribution for an example LWC
file.  There can be only one scattering file input to propgen when using
an LWC input file instead of a particle input file.


                  Scattering Table Format

The scattering tables have a six line header.  Propgen only reads the
wavelength range in the second header line and the number of effective
radii on the sixth header line.  After the header, for each effective
radius entry in a scattering table, there is one line with the effective
radius, the volume extinction coefficient (km^-1 for a mass content of 1
g/m^3), the single scattering albedo, and the order (Nleg) of the
Legendre or Wigner d-function series of the phase function/matrix. 
Propgen can read unpolarized or polarized scattering table formats,
which differ in the phase function/matrix series coefficients.  The
unpolarized format contains one or more lines with the the Nleg+1
Legendre series coefficients, starting with chi0 (which must be equal to
1).  The polarized format contains six similar series, with each one
starting a new line with the number 1 through 6.  The order of the six
Wigner d-function series is the four diagonal phase matrix elements (a1,
a2, a3, a4) followed by the I-Q and U-V matrix elements (b1, b2). The
first (I-I) and fourth (V-V) Wigner d-function series are regular
Legendre series.  For an example scattering table, see one of the
scattering table files produced by the example script.

                        PLOTSCATTAB

Plotscattab calculates phase functions (or phase matrix elements) as a
function of scattering angle from a scattering table produced by
make_mie_table or make_tmatrix_table or from the tabulated phase
functions in a property file.  The scattering tables and property files
stores the phase function as a Legendre series, and the other phase
matrix elements as Wigner d-function series, so plotscattab sums the
series for a specified number of discrete scattering angles.  Several
phase functions for different effective radius and particular phase
matrix elements (P11, P22, P33, P44, P12, P34) may be selected for
conversion.  The phase matrix elements beyond P11 may also be output as
a ratio to P11.  A graphing program can be used to plot the output of
plotscattab.  

               Plotting file format

The output file from plotscattab contains a four line header and then
